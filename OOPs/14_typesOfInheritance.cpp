// Types of inheritance
//01 Single inheritance
// Single inheritance is defined as the inheritance in which a derived
// class is inherited from the only one base class.

//02 Multilevel inheritance
// When one class inherits another class which is further inherited by
// another class, it is known as multi level inheritance in C++.
// Inheritance is transitive so the last derived class acquires all the
// members

//03 Multiple Inheritance
// Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from
// more than one class. i.e one subclass is inherited from more than one
// base class.rs of all its base classes.

//04 Hierarchical Inheritance
// Hierarchical inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than
// one class from a base class.

//05 Hybrid Inheritance
// Hybrid inheritance is a combination of more than one type of inheritance.
