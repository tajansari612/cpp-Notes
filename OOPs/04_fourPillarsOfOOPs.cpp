// Abstraction:
// The concept allows us to hide the implementation from the user but shows 
// only essential information to the user. Using the concept developer can 
// easily make changes and added over time.

// Encapsulation:
// Encapsulation is a mechanism that allows us to bind data and functions of a 
// class(methods) into an entity. 
// It protects data and functions from outside interference and misuse called 
// as data hiding by making data & methods as private or protected. 
// Therefore, it also provides security. 
// A class is the best example of encapsulation.

// Inheritance:
// The concept allows us to inherit or acquire the properties of an existing 
// class (parent class) into a newly created class (child class). 
// It is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability.

// Polymorphism:
// The word polymorphism is derived from the two words i.e. poly and morphs. 
// Poly means many and morphs means forms. It allows us to create methods with 
// the same name but different method signatures. It allows the developer to 
// create clean, sensible, readable, and resilient code.
