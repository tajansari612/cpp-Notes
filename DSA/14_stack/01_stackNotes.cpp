// This data structure works on the LIFO technique, where LIFO stands for Last
// In First Out. The element which was first inserted will be extracted at the
// end and so on. There is an element called as 'top' which is the element at
// the upper most position. All the insertion and deletion operations are made
// at the top element itself in the stack.

// Stacks in the application areas are implied as the container adaptors.

// The containers should have a support for the following list of operations:
// isEmpty
// isFull
// size
// top
// push
// pop

// push:
// Adds an item to the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an
// Overflow condition.

// pop:
// Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order
// in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an
// Underflow condition.

// top:
// Returns the top element of the stack.

// isEmpty:
// Returns true if the stack is empty, else false.

// isFull:
// Returns true if the stack is full, else false.

// Implementation of Stack:
// The basic operations that can be performed on a stack include push, pop,
// and peek. There are two ways to implement a stack â€“
//01 Using array
//02 Using linked list
