// This data structure works on the FIFO technique, where FIFO stands for First In
// First Out. The element which was first inserted will be extracted at the first
// and so on. There is an element called as 'front' which is the element at the
// front most position or say the first position, also there is an element called
// as 'rear' which is the element at the last position. In normal queues insertion
// of elements take at the rear end and the deletion is done from the front.

// The containers should have a support for the following list of operations:
// empty
// size
// push_back
// pop_front
// front
// back

// empty:
// The function is used to test for the emptiness of a queue. If the queue is
// empty the function returns true else false.

// size:
// The function returns the size of the queue container, which is a measure of the
// number of elements stored in the queue.

// push_back/enqueue:
// The function is used for the insertion of a new element at the rear end of the
// queue.

// pop_front/dequeue:
// The function is used for the deletion of element; the element in the queue is
// deleted from the front end.

// front:
// The function is used to access the front element of the queue. The element
// plays a very important role as all the deletion operations are performed at
// the front element.

// back:
// The function is used to access the rear element of the queue. The element plays
// a very important role as all the insertion operations are performed at the rear
// element.


// Implementation of Queue:
// The basic operations that can be performed on a queue include push, pop,front,
// and back. There are two ways to implement a stack â€“
//01 Using array
//02 Using linked list
